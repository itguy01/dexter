			<h2 class="title">Welcome to the Kill Room</h2>

			<h2 class="title">Dexter Morgan</h2>
			<p> <img src="images/dexter_morgan_index.jpg" alt="Dexter Morgan Index" width="250" height="250" class="alignleft" />At the crime scene involving the brutal slaying and dismemberment of Dexter's birth mother, Laura Moser, police officer Harry Morgan found a son in the blood drenched boy he rescued from starvation and eternal darkness... or so he thought. Blood washes away, memories fade, but darkness is sticky and stubborn. It is not long before Harry begins to see, in his own son, shadows of that terrible day. What Harry does next changes Dexter forever; he becomes determined to channel Dexter's darkness with deliberate and methodical training. The "code of Harry", as the adult Dexter calls it, personifies a vision born of a good man's heart and the cold pragmatism of its broken walls.</p>
			<p>Because of the things that happened when he was younger, his brain has grouped these thoughts of murder and labeled them with an image of the "dark passenger" inside his brain. <br />
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li class="first">Dexter kills his brother, Brian Moser, in the final episode of Season 1, Born Free</li>
				<li>Dexter kills Santos Jimenez, The man who killed his mother, in Season 2, Episode 8, Morning Comes</li>
				<li class="last">Dexter discovers that Harry did not die from a heart attack, but committed suicide, and thinks it may be because Harry could not live with himself for making the code and encouraging Dexter to kill after walking into the garage after Dexter had killed Juan Rinez. Season 2, Episode 10, There's something about Harry</li>

			<h2 class="title">Debra Morgan</h2>
			<p> <img src="images/debra_morgan_index.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="alignleft" />Dexter's foster sister, she often felt overlooked and ignored by her own father in favor of Dexter. She sees herself as "the other Morgan" - less accomplished and less likeable than her brother. Perhaps because she was never her father's "favorite", she feels compelled to find "true love" and be prized by a man, which sadly leads her to several unsuccessful relationships. She lacks confidence in herself and wants to advance in her career as a police officer but relies too heavily on the approval of others. However, in Season 2, she comes out of her shell with the help of FBI Agent Lundy and starts to trust her own instincts and become a star on the police force. </p>
			<p>Plays down her own abilities and often uses profanity to the extreme, which makes her appear crass and unprofessional. </p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li class="first">Earnest, hardworking, loyal, funny </li>
				<li>Slick and professional, but often becomes unkempt before day's end</li>
				<li>Even though her career is her life, Deb also wants a real, romantic relationship. Of course, though, this being television, she can never quite get what she wants.</li>
				<li class="last">Deb has unflinching loyalty and she is a really good person. She has a huge heart. It is one of her failings as a cop though.</li>
